# RV32I-CPU

A RISC-V CPU written in Verilog. Tomasulo's algorithm is applied to support out-of-order execution.

## Modules

- IFetch: Instruction Fetcher with ICache and Branch Predictor.
  - ICache: 16 cache lines, each line contains 16 instructions.  
    Total size: 16\*16\*4=1024 Bytes.  
    Read the entire cache line from memory if cache misses.
  - Branch Predictor: Maintain a 2-bit saturating counter for each entry.  
    Use 8 bits of pc to index into one of 256 counters.
  - Do not issue instruction if RS/LSB/ROB is full in the next cycle.
- Decoder: decode and issue instruction, purely combinational logic. (So whether to issue a new instruction is determined by IFetch.)
  - Extract opcode, funct3, funct7, rs1, rs2, rd, and imm from instruction.
  - For rs1 and rs2,
    - if the register is renamed, calculate its rob_id;
    - if not, read its value from RegFile.
- RegFile: Register File, stores the value of 32 registers (and its rob_id, if it is renamed).
- MemCtrl: Memory Controller, handles memory accesses from IFetch and LSB.
  - Read all the data (e.g. an entire cache line for IFetch, 4 bytes of data for LoadWord) and return it in one cycle with "done" signal set to true.
- RS: Reservation Station. 16 entries.
- ALU: Arithmetic Logic Unit of RS.
- LSB: Load Store Buffer. 16 entries.
  - I/O read should wait until it becomes the head of ROB to avoid the execution of incorrect I/O read (which will destroy later I/O reads).
  - Store instruction should wait until it is committed in ROB.
- ROB: Reorder Buffer. 16 entries.

Note: Sometimes you need to re-program the device before running statement_test to get correct result.
